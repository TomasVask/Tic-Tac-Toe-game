## Overview

### The challenge

Short description:
- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- Game results are saved in sessionStorage so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- In solo version when playing against computer, computer runs in three different modes:
  - first it tracks proactively scenarios to win the game;
  - if no winning scenarios, then CPU detects prevention scenarios to block users win;
  - if no winning scenarios and no prevention scenarios, then CPU randomly chooses cells.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- DOM
- Express.js

### What I learned

Loads of work with DOM. 
Creating modals was a new experience. 
The biggest challenge wsa to create the logic for CPU independent moves, both random as well as predefined.
In order to make UX smoother I used setTimeout functions to slightly slower CPU moves, but that caused side issues which took some time to work around.
Saving results to sessionStorage was also new thing to learn. 

### Continued development

Need to work on error handling. 
Also will work on projects that include JSON files, APIs, DBs.
